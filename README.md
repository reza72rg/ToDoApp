# Todo List Program

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)


This is a Todo List program built with Django, which allows users to record and manage their daily tasks. The program provides a user-friendly interface to prevent forgetting important tasks. It also includes a REST API to retrieve data from the program. The project is Dockerized for easy deployment and management.

## Features

- **Todo List Management**: Users can create, update, and delete tasks in their todo list.
- **User Authentication**: The program uses the Django `AbstractBaseUser` to customize the user model, providing secure user authentication.
- **Docker Support**: The project includes a Docker structure for easy deployment and management.
- **API Support**: The app includes a REST API that allows users to interact with the app's functionality programmatically. The API documentation can be found at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/`.
- **Email Verification**: The app uses the `smtp4dev` element in the Docker file format to send emails and verify user accounts.
- **Testing**: The app includes unit tests written with `pytest` to ensure the correctness of different parts of the app.
- **Random Data Generation**: The app utilizes the `faker` library to create random data for testing and populating the database.
- **Performance Testing**: The app includes an API tolerance threshold that allows testing the performance using artificial traffic generated by Locust. The performance testing can be accessed at `http://127.0.0.1:8089/`.
- **Background Tasks**: The app explores the use of background tasks in Django projects by integrating with Brokers like Redis and using the Celery module to create and manage different tasks.
- **Caching**: The app implements caching of information in different views using Redis to improve performance.
