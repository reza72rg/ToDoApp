# Todo List Program

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

This is a Todo List program built with Django, which allows users to record and manage their daily tasks. The program provides a user-friendly interface to prevent forgetting important tasks. It also includes a REST API to retrieve data from the program. The project is Dockerized for easy deployment and management.

## Features

- **Todo List Management**: Users can create, update, and delete tasks in their todo list.
- **User Authentication**: The program uses the Django `AbstractBaseUser` to customize the user model, providing secure user authentication.
- **Docker Support**: The project includes a Docker structure for easy deployment and management.
- **API Support**: The app includes a REST API that allows users to interact with the app's functionality programmatically. The API documentation can be found at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/`.
- **Email Verification**: The app uses the `smtp4dev` element in the Docker file format to send emails and verify user accounts.
- **Testing**: The app includes unit tests written with `pytest` to ensure the correctness of different parts of the app.
- **Random Data Generation**: The app utilizes the `faker` library to create random data for testing and populating the database.
- **Performance Testing**: The app includes an API tolerance threshold that allows testing the performance using artificial traffic generated by Locust. The performance testing can be accessed at `http://127.0.0.1:8089/`.
- **Background Tasks**: The app explores the use of background tasks in Django projects by integrating with Brokers like Redis and using the Celery module to create and manage different tasks.
- **Caching**: The app implements caching of information in different views using Redis to improve performance.

## Performance Testing

Using Locust, the API tolerance threshold is created and its performance is checked by generating artificial traffic on the site. It can be tested at the address `http://127.0.0.1:8089/`.

### Setup
To get this repository, run the following command inside your git enabled terminal
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alibigdeli/Django-FBV-DRF-TodoApp
```

### Getting ready
Create an enviroment in order to keep the repo dependencies seperated from your local machine.
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Make sure to install the dependencies of the project through the requirements.txt file.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have installed django and other packages, go to the cloned repo directory and run the following command

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```

This will create all the migrations file (database migrations) required to run this App.

Now, to apply this migrations run the following command
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### options
Project it self has the user creation form but still in order to use the admin you need to create a super user.you can use the createsuperuser option to make a super user.
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

And lastly let's make the App run. We just need to start the server now and then we can start using our simple todo App. Start the server by following command

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Once the server is up and running, head over to http://127.0.0.1:8000 for the App.

### Reformat and check
If you want your code to be check by pep8 and all the guide lines, there are two packages added to requirements in order to check and reformat code.
you can use it by this command:
```bash
black -l 79 . && flake8
```
### Database schema
